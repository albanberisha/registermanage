Axis Solutions LTD values your security and privacy. Protecting your privacy is one of our top priorities. This privacy policy sets out how we collect information regarding Website users, what we may do with it, and what you can do to protect your privacy.
<strong>How do we protect your personal information?</strong>
We implement a variety of security measures to maintain the safety of your personal information when you enter, submit, or access your personal information.
We offer the use of a secure server. All supplied sensitive/credit information is transmitted via Secure Socket Layer (SSL) technology and then encrypted into our Payment gateway providers database only to be accessible by those authorized with special access rights to such systems, and are required to keep the information confidential.
After a transaction, your private information (credit cards, social security numbers, financials, etc.) will not be stored on our servers.
Keeping your password safe: You should make sure that you don’t share the password with anyone and remember that Axis Solutions LTD’ personnel will never ask you for the password. If this happens and someone claims to be working for Axis Solutions LTD, don’t provide them with any information and make sure you notify our customer service at once. Pick a password that is hard to intercept and change it every couple of months. Also remember to log out as soon as you stop trading with Axis Solutions LTD, whenever you leave the computer and after every session.
The first step to start trading is to open an account and this process, simple as it is, requires you to enter some personal data such as your first and last name, email and phone number. Additional details, as well as proof of identity may be required of you at any time Axis Solutions LTD will maintain the privacy of all your personal data we collect, including age, occupation or marital status. You may be required to provide the copies of ID, passport and photograph, in accordance with any policies, laws or regulations that require such documents to be delivered. Furthermore, in some jurisdiction you may also need to submit financial information, investment experience and risk tolerance, all as may be required under law.
In order to have unrestricted access to the trading account and be able to trade with ease, these documents and information may be required. There is no obligation on your part to submit them, but if you don’t, you won’t be able to open the account and trade online. Additionally, it is important to keep us informed about your personal data as soon as something important changes, so your profile will always be up to date, and as required under any law.
We collect this information to administer and operate services, prevent fraud, defend our legal rights and for the purpose of compliance with regulations regarding the services we provide. Axis Solutions LTD’ privacy policy guarantees that your personal information will not be sold, rented or traded, and won’t be disclosed unless the following conditions occur or for the purposes set out above. We share information with the associated firms and other persons processing your personal information or with banks and clearing houses in order to deliver the products and services you need for trading.
When there is any suspicion of fraud or breach regarding the trading performed by the user, the privacy policy allows us to disclose your private data as needed, including to credit reference and fraud prevention agencies. The same applies for the national an international enforcement bodies and courts when they require this kind of information, as laws and regulations demand. Except for these situations, while you are trading with Axis Solutions LTD, your personal information is reasonably safe from unauthorized use, damage, modification or disclosure, by all reasonable measures.
